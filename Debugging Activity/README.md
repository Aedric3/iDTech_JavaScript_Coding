# Debugging Activity
In this assignment, students are given 4 different programs, of which we choose 3 to debug to complete the assignment. Those programs all have certain errors in the code, which students must identify and fix using their programming knowledge, the techniques learned in the lesson(s). 
We make use of VSCODE's Debug Terminal to help identify the problems in the code.
